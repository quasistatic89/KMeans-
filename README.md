# KMeans-
Shows an implementation for KMeans++  clustering algorithm and shows how it converges much faster than the standard Llyod's algorithm. 

Also analyses if clusters show significant differences on covariates that were not used in the clustering algorithm. This would help in predicting confidence intervals for that covariate based on the movies assigned cluster ID.
